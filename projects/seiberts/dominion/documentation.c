Description of smithy
If the smithy card is selected, a for loop begins and loops for three iterations.
After each iteration, the draw card function is called which adds a new card to the playerâ€™s 
hand. After the loop has completed, the smithy card is discarded from the players hand.

/******************************************************************************
Description of adventurer
If the adventurer card is selected, a while loop is run until the player draws a 
treasure card. Within this loop, if it is determined that the remaining deck is found to 
have no remaining cards, then the discarded pile of cards is reshuffled, placed back
in the deck, and then used to draw from. If a copper, silver, or gold treasure card is 
found, then the loop ends. If a treasure card is drawn initially, then that card is placed
into the players hand and the while loop is not activated.
