smithyCard()
--The loop will run five times instead of three so it will draw five cards
instead of three.  

adventurerCard()
--After the drawn card function, the drawntreasures variable is incremented by one. Thus 
the while loop will only run once or twice at most. It'll run once after the player
draws one card and the  the first card is a treasure card. 
It'll run twice after the player draws two cards.
